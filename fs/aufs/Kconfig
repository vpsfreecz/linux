	help
	Aufs is a stackable unification filesystem such as Unionfs,
	which unifies several directories and provides a merged single
	directory.
	In the early days, aufs was entirely re-designed and
	re-implemented Unionfs Version 1.x series. Introducing many
	original ideas, approaches and improvements, it becomes totally
	different from Unionfs while keeping the basic features.
